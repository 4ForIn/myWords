# my_words

Application that helps you to collect, save and learn words of a new language. In the initial version, these are: Polish, English and Turkish.
The saved words are stored in local database.
Authentication with firebase authentication: log in with email and password,
and with google account.
Every user has his own word's list.
You can searrch words by language and add to favorites.

It is a learning Flutter project, so functionality is limited.
For example the My exercise section probably will not be done.


The reason I have used many packages is only to learn more.
The project includes:
redux, firebase, sqlfLite, google_sign_in, and others.

## Type of project

This project is not commercial.
